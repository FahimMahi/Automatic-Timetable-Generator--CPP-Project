# Automatic-Timetable-Generator--CPP-Project
This console-based project was completed by me a long time ago, in 2020, during the Introduction to Programming course in my first semester of university. The automatic timetable generator project aims to efficiently schedule classes, resources, and activities within an educational institution through algorithmic optimization.
